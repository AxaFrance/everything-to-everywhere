# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As contributors, we pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting different points of view and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized, violent, or discriminatory language or images
- Personal attacks or insults
- Public or private harassment
- Trolling, offensive comments, or personal remarks
- Posting private information about others, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the acceptable standards of behavior and must take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, contributions, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not comply to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that do not comply with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using a project email address, posting from an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality about the reporter of the incident.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project leadership.
